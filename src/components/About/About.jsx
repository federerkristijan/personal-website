        Originally from Zagreb, Croatia, based in Berlin, Germany. I'm a digital native, cosmopolite and polyglot, driven by a
        self-managing 'Can-do' mindset and positive attitude, that would be a
        rejuvenating addition to your team!
        Currrently am looking for front-end developer role in an IT company,
        with a healthy work enivronment, that would allow me to dive deeper into
        wonderful world of coding, to embrace new creative challenges, and further develop my skills and learn new ones.
